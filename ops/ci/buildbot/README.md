# Buildbot
Refer to the subfolders' readme for further information:

* `configuration`: the Python code used to configure buildbot
* `images`: the docker images for the buildbot master and worker.

The other directories are not part of what needs to be deployed:
* `local-run`: enables running buildbot locally for testing purposes.
* `e2e`: the end to end tests of this. It assumes that the images are built.
